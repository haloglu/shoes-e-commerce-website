# Shoes E-commerce Website

 This is a simple e-commerce website for shoes. It displays a slider with different shoe models and colors, and allows the user to choose a product and customize its color and size. There's also a payment page where the user can finalize the purchase.

## Installation

 To run this project locally, simply download the code and open the index.html file in your web browser.
 
## Usage

 The slider at the top of the page displays the available shoe models. Clicking on a model will update the product information below the slider, including the title, price, image, and available colors. Clicking on a color will change the image of the shoe to that color.

The user can also choose the size of the shoe by clicking on one of the size options below the image. The chosen size will be highlighted in black.

To purchase the shoe, the user can click on the "Buy now" button below the product information. This will open a payment page where the user can enter their payment information.
